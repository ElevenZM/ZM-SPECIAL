# ZM-SPECIAL
!! PLEASE READ THIS DISCLAIMER FIRST !!

- Do not consult the servers or devs of HDR or ZM:SPECIAL when you are having trouble installing this or have experienced bugs or crashes.
- This is not an officially supported method. It was only something I was approved of to write by the lead of HDR, Black Calculus.
- This tutorial was only tested on ZM:SPECIAL beta 1.1.5, HewDraw Remix v0.6.30 beta, Atmosphere 1.3.2, ARCropolis v3.4.0, SSBU 3.1.0, all on Nintendo Switch.
I will not be making a Ryujinx tutorial. Again, don't consult servers or devs about this.
- This was only playtested by me for a little. I am not 100% familiar with everything in HDR either, so I am not sure that this will be 100% accurate.
During my playtest, I did not experience any crashes.



To Install HDR while you already have ZM:SPECIAL:

1. On your SD card, move these files:
atmosphere\contents\01006A800016E000\exefs\main.npdm
atmosphere\contents\01006A800016E000\exefs\subsdk9
Into a new folder in the same location, so you can use them again when you aren't using HDR.

2. Copy those above files from HDR switch-package to your SD card.

3. From HDR, copy these files:
atmosphere\contents\01006A800016E000\romfs\skyline\plugins\hdr-launcher.nro

Onto your SD card in the same location.

Onto your SD card in the same location.

7. Launch Supeer Smash Bros. Ultimate and press Play on HDR like usual.

Some will say the game may crash.
One warning will ask if you would like to delete libsmashline_hook_development.nro. Select No.
For the rest of the warnings, continue through them.

9. Wait a little bit, and ZM:SPECIAL + HDR will properly start.
